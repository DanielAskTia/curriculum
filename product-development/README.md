# Product Development

Code Cooperative students build technology solutions to
the problems that affect them and their communities.

The product: A website that addresses a problem you have
identified in your community.

## 1. The Problem

The first step to building your project is to **start
with the problem**. Pick a problem that you have identified and
make sure you understand it.

Ways to understand the problem:
* Observe it
* Talk with the users experiencing it
* Find market research about it

Become an expert on the problem!

You should be able to answer the following questions:
* What is the problem you are trying to solve?
* Why is this problem happening?
* Who does this problem affect?
* What do they need to solve the problem and why?
* Why is this problem important to you?

## 2. The Solution

Brainstorm multiple solutions
Come up with at least 10 ideas

TODO Link to brainstorming video

Choose a solution that:
* You believe will address the problem
* You can build in a reasonable amount of time
* You feel passionately about

You should be able to clearly describe your solution with
a sentence that starts with "A website that...".

## 3. Minimum Viable Product

A **Minimum Viable Product (or MVP)** is a product with just
enough features to get the job done and test with users so that
improvements can be made later.

One of the most important principles in building technology
is to **launch fast and iterate**.

In order to get our product out to users as quickly as possible,
we set the scope of our MVP and stick to it.

The scope of our MVP will be defined by:
* A list of features
  * The user will be able to...
* A list of pages (can be 1 page)
  * eg. Home page, about page,...
* Wireframes for each page (and optionally user flows)

### Setting the scope of your MVP

* Create a list of features for your website
  * On this website, the user will be able to...
* From the list of features, decide how many pages your website will have. Your website may just have 1 page!
  * Example: YouTube MVP might have 3 pages (Home page, search page, video page)
* For each page, make a list of the what will go on the page
  * Example: YouTube video page - video, video title, video author, comments, similar videos
* Make wireframes for all the pages of your MVP with pen and paper (you should use 1 piece of paper per page)
  * Optionally, you can create them with https://wireframe.com afterwards

## 4. Project Planning

Once we have set the scope of our MVP (what?), we can start planning how we will build our project (how?).

### Tech spec

A **tech spec** is a document that helps you plan out your code
before you start coding. It details the approach you will take to building your project.

Your tech spec should answer the following questions:
* What technologies and/or languages will you use?
* List all the files you will need to create.
* What are some challenges you anticipate running into?
* Is there any complex logic? Plan it out with pseudocode or diagrams.
* How long do you think it will take to build each page/component?
* Do you have any questions about how to start?

### Weekly goals

Setting and keeping track of goals is the best way to finish
a project in time.

With your mentor, make a list of coding goals for the upcoming
weeks. Start with what is most important (HTML, must-have content, core functionality) and end with nice-to-haves (design tweaks, cool animations, details).

Keep track of your weekly goals your [Team Progress Tracking document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cO_27t2KBDFA3bzAn-YGNKSsk9_1L3XDVLHDAg7jn4c/edit).

### Scope Creep

Scope creep is what happens when we add to the scope of our
project after we have started building it. There may
be some good reasons to add to our MVP, but in general, we
heavily discourage this.

Beware of scope creep! When in doubt, ask yourself: "Is this a Minimum Viable Product component?"
