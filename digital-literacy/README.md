# Digital Literacy

### Objectives
**Overall Objective:** Mentees will achieve improved digital literacy and increase their knowledge around each subject area from the Digital Literacy Survey: computer basics, the internet, search, email, digital security, software applications for productivity and using mobile devices.

**Secondary Objective:** Mentees will become more comfortable researching and learning about topics in digital literacy on their own.

### Digital Literary Placement
Incoming mentees take our [Digital Literacy Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBFKSurD0ce4x5KMOFXpww1wGLXE6BsEHFyIkcKjdJQiTsgg/viewform) before starting the program, so your volunteer coordinator will let you know before the program starts whether your mentee is at a beginner/intermediate/advanced level. (The evaluation/leveling script can be found [here](https://github.com/mermatriarchy/ew_eval_script), if ruby is your thing.) 

Advanced users do not need to incorporate any of the units into the 16 week program, but a suggested schedules for beginner/intermediate users can be found [here](#suggested-weekly-schedule).

### How to use this curriculum
Each section can be taught as a stand alone unit, or as a series. If a mentee is already proficient in one or many areas, the mentee can focus on the areas where they most want to improve their digital literacy.

During your first meeting with your mentee, you can use the [digital proficiency pairing assessment](digital-proficiency-pairing.md) to get a sense of your mentee's digital literacy, and set up some folders and files for the program.

Each lesson plan has a list of topics that correspond with items covered in our Tech Literacy Survey. Lessons are meant to elaborate on the areas we ask about in the survey. Some lessons, such as The Internet and Computer Basics, come with step-by-step instructions on how to accomplish each task. Because there are already a lot of How-To guides on the internet, the lessons following Computer Basics/The Internet link to external blog posts or documentation that cover the topics in the lesson (all links are kept up to date, so none of the resources should be stale, but if a link is broken, please let us know). Both the step-by-step lesson format and the externally linked resources can be used as a guide for the types of tasks to talk about and practice with your mentee. If your mentee is more advanced and feels comfortable doing self study, the lessons can be assigned as homework to review the documentation and practice the tasks themselves. If your mentee is an intermediate/beginner level and feels less comfortable with self study, you can pair on some of the tasks and talk them through the process outlined in each topic. Additional resources and activities are listed for more practice/discussion. Regardless of whether your mentee will be focused on self-study or pairing, we highly recommend helping them find videos on [Digital Learn](https://www.digitallearn.org/) that correspond to the topics covered below.

| Unit | Prerequisites |
| --- | --- |
| Computer Basics | None |
| The Internet | Computer Basics |
| Search | Computer Basics, The Internet |
| Email | Computer Basics, The Internet |
| Digital Security | Computer Basics, The Internet |
| Productivity | Computer Basics, The Internet |
| Mobile | None |

### Suggested Weekly Schedule
**Beginner Level:**
- 2 units/week for 4 weeks
- Computer Basics and The Internet should be covered first, but other units can be done in any order

**Intermediate Level:** 
- Focus on pain points identified in pairing assessment during the first two weeks of the programming curriculum 
- Time spent on digital literacy can be split with the HTML/CSS topics (recommend about 30 minutes out of the 2 hour session)
- Assign any topics not covered in a unit during the 2 hour session as homework for self-review and study
- Activities can optionally be recommended as homework
- Learning can be self-paced: if a mentee works through their pain points quickly, thereâ€™s no need to devote additional time during lessons to digital literacy; if some topics take longer, lesson time can continue to be devoted to digital literacy topics
