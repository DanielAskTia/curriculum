# Javascript

## Overview

The JavaScript curriculum is designed to give mentees an overview of JavaScript so they can begin to build a knowledge of types, variables, functions, classes and objects in JS. The goal is to give mentees a strong foundation so they can feel comfortable with basic JS programming, debugging and troubleshooting. The cirriculum is made up of lessons sourced from other programs and free learning platforms; each source is credited with the latest link in the below section along with the slides that are available in the corresponding folders. We're working on sourcing several different cirriculums and compiling them here to give our mentors a thorough and detailed lesson library to cover the foundations of coding in JS, as well as more advanced topics (the HTTP request cycle, asychronous requests, databases and APIs). For now, using the links to the lessons will be easiest while we work on structuring the assets here.

The lessons found here are meant to be covered in 1:1 mentorship sessions; to supplement the topics covered, mentees can run through the exercises in this folder or start one of the suggested projects.

## Available Lessons

### Intro to JavaScript from Teaching-Materials.org

Source: [https://www.teaching-materials.org/javascript/](https://www.teaching-materials.org/javascript/)

This overview of JS is divided into 3 lessons, but each lesson covers a lot of material and can be divided into smaller lessons, or covered at whatever pace is best for the mentee.

Each lesson comes with slides, exercises, homework and additional reading, which can all be found at the link above; materials have been copied here in case there are dead links.

[Lesson 1](teaching-materials.org/lesson-1/README.md): Intro to Programming and Intro to JS, Variables and Functions<br>
[Lesson 2](teaching-materials.org/lesson-2/README.md): Control Flows and Arrays<br>
[Lesson 3](teaching-materials.org/lesson-3/README.md): Objects

### Intro to Web Development from Code Nation

Code Nation is a program that provides under-resourced high schools with coding classes (you can check out their website [here](https://codenation.org/) to learn more). Their curriculum is available online and their web development track has useful lessons/slides related to JS (some of the JS curriculum uses jQuery, which can be a good introductory library).
