# Javascript

## Overview
The JavaScript curriculum is designed to give mentees an overview of JavaScript so they can begin to build a knowledge of types, variables, functions, classes and objects in JS. The goal is to give mentees a strong foundation so they can feel comfortable with basic JS programming, debugging and troubleshooting. The cirriculum is made up of lessons sourced from other programs and free learning platforms; each source is credited with the latest link in the below section along with the slides that are available in the corresponding folders. We've sourced several different cirriculums and compiled them here to give our mentors a thorough and detailed lesson library to cover the foundations of coding in JS, as well as more advanced topics (the HTTP request cycle, asychronous requests, databases and APIs).

The lessons found here are meant to be covered in 1:1 mentorship sessions; to supplement the topics covered, mentees can run through the exercises in this folder or start one of the suggested projects.

Looking for a particular topic to review review with your mentee? Refer to this sheet for a better breakdown of which lessons contain which topics.
