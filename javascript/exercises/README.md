# Practice Exercises

These exercises are meant to give students extra practice to internalize the basics of JavaScript. They're divided into different concepts and can be done during a mentorship session or as homework. The file can be run in the terminal or browser, or in a repl such as [replit.com](https://replit.com/) (you have to register, but it's free to join). Each file has a corresponding answer sheet; there's more than one correct answer, but the answers are meant as general approaches.

The concepts progress in order of difficulty as:
- Types
- Arithmetic Operators
- Conditional Statements
- Arrays
- Functions 
- Class and Objects
- Promises 
- Writing tests
