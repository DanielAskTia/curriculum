# Code Cooperative Curriculum

## Description

The Code Cooperative curriculum is **a guide** that supports our mentors and students in their learning goals & development of their project.

Each student has different learning goals and each project is different so this curriculum is a resource that doesnâ€™t aim to cover everything but rather serves as a jumping off point and something for our members to come back to when they need help.

## Code of Conduct

The Code Cooperative is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all Code Cooperative spaces, including our classes, events, communications, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Core Team.

Some Code Cooperative spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

A longer version of our Code of Conduct exists [here](code-of-conduct.md).
