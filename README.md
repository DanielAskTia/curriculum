# Code Cooperative Curriculum

## Description

The Code Cooperative curriculum is **a guide** that supports our mentors and students in their learning goals & development of their project.

Each student has different learning goals and each project is different so this curriculum is a resource that doesnâ€™t aim to cover everything but rather serves as a jumping off point and something for our members to come back to when they need help.

## Learning with this curriculum

The best way to work with this curriculum is to go through the following sections in order. Pay attention to the prerequisites for each section.

Section | Description | Prerequisite knowledge
---|---|---
[1. Project Showcase](project-showcase) | Examples projects to serve as inspiration for students | None
[2. Digital Literacy](digital-literacy) | Digital literacy guide | None
[3. Code](code) | Project based web development curriculum | Typing, navigating your computer's file system, using Google to search for information, navigating websites
[4. Product Development](product-development) | Guide to help our students develop their final project | Building a simple website (HTML, CSS)
