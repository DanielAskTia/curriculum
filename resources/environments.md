# Environments

There are several options on how to code these days:


Developing from your personal computer provides learners with a lot of benefits. However, for some learners who already have experience with coding websites locally, they might prefer something else. Here are some things to keep in mind:

## Local Environment

Benefits:
* General computer environment like operating system and navigation are familiar to the learner. This can help them focus just on coding without worrying about learning a new set of navigation tools.
* They can complete exercises surrounding the concepts of servers and how websites are also stored on "computers" like their own.
* No need to worry about coding with shaky Internet service.
* Great for working on large/team projects.
* Easier to install and customize a linter or auto-formatter for your editor.

Drawbacks:
* It may take a while to install coding software and their dependencies. This might initially discourage them from learning to code.
* Deploying their site or project could take some time and involve finding a cloud service and learning more devops jargen.

Here are some recommendations for code editors to use:

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * Check out their pair programming tool
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  * Easy to use UI with GitHub
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  * Might be annoying when it asks you for money to buy a liscence

## Online IDE

Benefits:
* Usually great for pair-programming and showing live typing and syntax highlighting.
* Automatically saves files and deploy as you type.
* Great for small projects that can be shown on any computer (not just your own).

Drawbacks:
* May not be the most "realistic" way of coding in a industrial setting.
* May not support tools like Git or NPM dependencies.

Here are some recommendations for services that have been used by other mentor/mentee pairings:

* [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
  * Offers templates for web projects and a terminal window
* [Replit](https://replit.com/)
  * Light-weight and can be used to teach coding languages like Python and Java
