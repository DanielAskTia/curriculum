# Glossary

This is a crowd-resourced glossary specifically made for beginners to coding. Definitions are in content to learning how to build a website and understanding the Internet. We encourage you to use cmd/ctrl + F to find the definition of a term.

The definitions should be sourced by either a person or by another website.

***

#### syntax
A set of rules that define what the various combinations of symbols mean. ([source](https://blog.devmountain.com/what-is-syntax-in-computer-programming-javascript-101/)). Examples of syntax: `<body></body>`

#### scripting language
In web development, scripting language is a language that instructs a browser what to display. `html` is an example of a scripting language. [source](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-a-scripting-language)

#### nesting
The act of grouping and layering snippets of code. It can be visualized as a family tree; a snippet of code can be a parent to another snippet of code. In HTML, this can be adding `<div>` inside of another `<div>`. In languages like Javascript, you can write a for loop inside a for loop (called nested-for loops). [source](https://www.thoughtco.com/nesting-html-tags-3466475)

#### algorithm
A set of instructions that usually takes some input and returns an output. A math equation is an algorithm. A cooking recipe could be an algorithm. A Javascript `function` is an algorithm. [source](https://theconversation.com/what-is-an-algorithm-how-computers-know-what-to-do-with-data-146665)

#### boilerplate
A set of writing (usually code) that is reused for other programs. The `<head></head>` of an HTML file can be considered boilerplate code for web development. [source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/whats-boilerplate-and-why-do-we-use-it-let-s-check-out-the-coding-style-guide-ac2b6c814ee7/)

#### frontend
Describes coding for what a user may see like the [UI](#user-interface-ui) of a website. [source](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/front-end-vs-back-end)

#### backend
Describes coding for what a user may not see or be aware of like code that accesses a [database](#database) or an API endpoint that's called when a button is clicked. [source](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/front-end-vs-back-end)

#### client
In web development, client is a user of a website. When used as *client-side*, it means code that deals with what is accessible to a user on a website. [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview)

#### server
In web development, server is a computer that can execute code and essentially talk to a [client](#client). When used as *server-side*, it  *usually* means code that is not visible to a user of a website. [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview)


#### Programming language
A language that can be converted to instructions that a machine can understand. [source](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages/)

#### user interface (UI)
The display that a user sees on a machine. This can be the windows that appear on a computer screen or a drive-thru order display. This is also known as a GUI (graphical user interface). [source](https://techterms.com/definition/user_interface)

#### compiler
a program that can convert code written in a programming language to [machine code](#machine-code). [source](https://lambda.uta.edu/cse5317/notes/node3.html)

#### database
An organized collection of structured information, or data. [source](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/)

#### editor / code editor
A software that used to write code. *If you use Microsoft Word to write a document, you use a code editor to write code.* [source](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/source-code-editor)

#### terminal / command line
A text interface that allows you to interact with your computer. [source](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands)

#### Pseudo code
A way of writing out an algorithm that's comprehensible to other humans. This usually means that pseudo code does not compile or follow rules of a programming langauge. However, it can ressemble a programming language. [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-write-a-pseudo-code/)

#### Foo / Bar
Words commonly used in example code when naming variables and other data. They carry no meaning other to be placeholders when a programmer is unable to come up with an example of a variable name. [source](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aetq)

#### Binary
Binary can refer to a base-2 system. Binary can also refer to a file of [machine code](#machine-code). [source](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/binary.htm).

#### Machine code
Instructions that are usually converted from code written in a programming language. Machine code usually looks like gibberish to the human eye. Ultimately, they execute electric flows in a computer's hardware to perform everything from restarting a computer to taking a photo on your phone.

#### File extension

#### CLI

#### Local environment
